The goal of *sleeprutil* is to facilitate data aggregation into the redcap database used for the NIH funded *SLEEPR* grant.

## Installation

You can install the  development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jskufca/sleeprutil")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(sleeprutil)
## basic example code
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
